Design notes
============

* AX = B
* A^(-1)AX = A^(-1)B
* IX = A^(-1)B
* X = A^(-1)B

1. Load the data
2. Calculate the inverse matrix
3. Multiply the inverse matrix Ã— the constants
4. Round the results and print them

* determinant: row of elem * sign * minor added
* minor: matrix that doesn't include row-col of elem, until it's a 2x2
* adjugate: matrix of sign * minor, transposed

Can build a matrix of cofactors: built it and then only use one row (or col) for final det.
